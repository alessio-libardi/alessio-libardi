# Hi, I'm Alessio 👋🏻

I'm a Software Engineer with experience since 2017 and a Philosophy student since 2022. I like to take on UI, UX, and DevEx challenges, focusing on creating smooth user experiences and making developer workflows easier. I also like to simplify and automate processes, combining my technical skills with a curiosity about life's bigger questions.
