### Hi there 👋🏻

I am a young developer with a passion for websites and in particular for the design and development of the user interface. My goal as a web developer is to design creative and technologically advanced projects.

My strengths are the creativity and the wide knowledge of the web and its problems such as responsive design, the horizontal and vertical stack as well as browser and multiplatform compatibility. Moreover I also particularly care about the design side regarding the choice of the typography and the color palette for the transmission of the right message to the user.

I'm interested in open source projects and I would love to collaborate with people around the world!
